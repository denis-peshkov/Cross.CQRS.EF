   • Removed switch-based logic in favor of internal strategy selection
3. Improved Documentation
   • Enhanced public API docs and parameter descriptions
   • Clarified registration order and execution logic
4.	Structural Improvements
   • Reorganized code into feature folders (e.g., Extensions)
   • Added project icon and minor formatting updates
   • Renamed "Solution Items" folder to "assets"
   • Added new `icon.svg` file to the project
5. Updated `SomeScopeExternalCommandHandler` implementation:
   • Modified constructor parameters
   • Changed `Events.Write` to `CommandEvents.Write`
   • Added support for logging
6. Added IntegrationTests
7. Move PaginationQuery and PaginationQueryHandler into separate library.
8. Removed `PaginationResult.cs` class from the project
Goal: Simplify transaction management, improve configurability, maintainability, and clarity.
